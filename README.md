# Hi, I'm Diogo Ara√∫jo üëãüèª

With a Master's Degree in Software Engineering and want to use my time with new work learnings and exploring new technologies, being available to work on my specialized field (tech, cyber-security and databases). 
In the University of Minho, I specialized in Data Engineering, learning various ways of transforming raw data into information, with a focus in SQL, Python, noSQL and ETL processes. Another speciality is Cybersecurity with a focus for Cryptography practicing Public Key and symmetrical crypto.
